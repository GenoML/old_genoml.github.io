title: Principles and Philosophy 
---

We are staunch advocates of open science, striving to make data and code easily accessible to the scientific community.

- Little to learn - The goal of GenoML is to democratize complex genomics and machine learning workflows. If you can 'cd' or 'ls', you should be able to use GenoML.

- Intuitive - We hope that everything is simple, straightforward and effective. From data munging to a tuned model in 3 lines of code.

- Layered architecture - GenoML is really a community and will constantly be growing. We keep workflows in logical layers so we can change or update one module and not effect the others.

- Sensible defaults - Nobody like having to think too much. We've locked in the sensible default setting sfor most workflows to keep modules un-cluttered and running smooth.

- No vendor-lock in - Integrate GenoML with your other code, other products, other platforms. This is open source. To quote Digital Underground "Doowutchyalike".
