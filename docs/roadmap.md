> Update 03/26/19

We consider GenoML v1 a beta, it's the aggregation of code we have been using internally for quite some time, allcoming from a variety of different projects and applications. Moving towards a more refined GenoML v2 and v3, we've set some goals below and a loose timeline. 

## Spring / summer 2019 (GenoMLv2)
This development cycle includes:
1. Upping speed and efficiency of the pipeline.
2. Transitioning to a majority python core.
3. Integrating additional alogirthms from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).
4. Generally making the pipeline and docs more user friendly.
5. Additional feature extraction and variant pre-filtering methods. 

## Fall /  winter 2019 (GenoMLv3)
This is when the exciting stuff really starts happening.

Everybody contributing to GenoML is really excited about the potential applications of federated learning and meta-learning methods in genomics.

Particularly in light of recent privacy legislation changes, it would be great to be able to learn across multiple data silos.

GenoMLv3 will include federated learning similar to what is outlined [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01046.pdf). 

Its alot of work, but we think it will be worth it.

GenoMLv1 testing is ongoing, wider distribution pending April 8th 2019.
Do not use versions < 1.0.3.
