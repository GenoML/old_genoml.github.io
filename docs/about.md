**GenoML** is an Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines for genomic data. In recent years, the demand for machine learning experts has outpaced the supply, despite the surge of people entering the field. To address this gap, there have been big strides in the development of user-friendly machine learning software that can be used by non-experts. The first steps toward simplifying machine learning involved developing simple, unified interfaces to a variety of machine learning algorithms (e.g. R, Python scikit-learn). Although R and python have made it easy to experiment with machine learning, there is still a fair bit of knowledge and background in data science that is required to produce high-performing machine learning models. Development of machine learning models for genomic data in particular are notoriously difficult for a non-expert to tune properly. 

In order for machine learning software to truly be accessible to non-experts, we have designed an easy-to-use interface which automates the process of training a large selection of candidate models. **GenoML** will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible models to find the best one for your data.

**GenoML** can also be a helpful tool for the advanced user, by providing a simple wrapper function that performs a large number of modeling-related tasks that would typically require many lines of code, and by freeing up their time to focus on other aspects of the data science pipeline tasks such as data-preprocessing, feature engineering and model deployment.

Please note **GenoML is still under active development** and we encourage you to check back on this repository regularly for updates.
